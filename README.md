Node.js Cat Fact Profile API
This is a simple, lightweight backend server built with native Node.js. It provides a single API endpoint that returns a static user profile combined with a random cat fact fetched from an external API. This project is designed to demonstrate core Node.js concepts, including handling HTTP requests, asynchronous operations, error handling, and environment variables without relying on external frameworks like Express.

‚ú® Features
Native Node.js Server: Built using only the core http module.

External API Integration: Fetches a random cat fact from https://catfact.ninja/fact on each request.

Robust Error Handling: Gracefully handles network errors and timeouts from the external API.

Environment-Ready: Uses dotenv to manage environment variables for configuration.

CORS Enabled: Includes Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers, making it ready for frontend integration.

Basic Logging: Logs incoming requests to the console for debugging.
